    "  Friends, we are very excited to announce **AI Sequrity Control** –- our first beta product to deploy DualLLM architecture for your AI instantiation with no headaches. **Sequrity Control** is not just yet another guardrail system –- it gives you much stronger guarantees and enables you to reason formally about requirements of your agent covering tool-use security policies and also even business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Most standard AI setups use a single, powerful LLM to both understand your instructions and interact with your data. This is the simplest approach, but it's also the most vulnerable. This mixing of control-flow (the instructions to execute) and untrusted data is the root cause of prompt injection vulnerabilities. For instance, a malicious instruction hidden in a calendar invite could trick the AI into leaking sensitive commercial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "  At [**sequrity.ai**](https://sequrity.ai/), we believe in a fundamentally different and more secure design. Instead of patching a broken model, we have re-architected the entire process with our Dual-LLM, \"Plan-Then-Execute\" architecture. This approach creates a formal separation between understanding instructions and acting on data, providing architectural guarantees that other solutions simply can't match.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The Planner LLM: This first model reads your prompt and creates a safe, step-by-step plan.\n",
    "  - The Security Checkpoint: This is our crucial innovation. This engine intercepts and analyzes the plan before any action is taken. It validates the plan against your defined policies, ensuring that malicious instructions found in your data can never become actions.\n",
    "  - Secure Execution: Only the vetted, secure steps of the plan are executed. Malicious instructions are correctly identified as data and ignored, preventing the instruction from ever crossing the boundary from data flow to control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Below, we give a number of examples of where Sequrity Control shines.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Stop Patching, Start Building on a Foundation of Certainty**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Sequrity Control offers a deterministic approach that makes the system's behavior predictable and auditable. It becomes architecturally impossible for the AI to violate your security policy. This fundamentally shifts liability from the unpredictable nature of an AI to the accountable decisions of a system user.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Our system enables you to enforce powerful, fine-grained policies. A policy isn't just about what role can use a certain tool; it's about defining specific conditions, such as allowing an action only if the user is a manager, the data is not personally identifiable information, and it's within work hours. This is the difference between a bouncer checking an ID at the door and a security guard monitoring actions inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Below we provide special use-cases where you can already use Control**:\n",

    "  ## Example 5: Audit, Fairness, Transparency, and Interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "  Beyond security, Sequrity Control provides powerful capabilities for **audit**, **fairness**, **transparency**, and **interpretability** in AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Auditability**: Every decision made by the AI is captured in an executable program that can be inspected, logged, and reviewed. The executed program is easy to audit and interpret — you can see exactly what tools were called, with what arguments, and in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Fairness**: Sequrity Control can enforce fairness constraints at the architectural level, preventing AI systems from making decisions based on protected attributes like race, gender, or ethnicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Transparency**: The policy enforcement mechanism makes it clear why certain actions were allowed or denied, providing full visibility into the AI's decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Interpretability**: Unlike black-box AI systems, the plan-then-execute architecture produces human-readable programs that explain exactly how the AI solved the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Below we demonstrate two fairness-focused features that showcase these principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### 5.1 Preventing Unfair Discrimination in Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "  When building AI agents that process applicant data (e.g., for hiring or loan applications), it's critical to ensure that\n",
    "  the AI does not make decisions based on protected attributes such as race, gender, or ethnicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Sequrity Control provides the `branching_meta_policy` feature that can detect when the AI attempts to use tagged data\n",
    "  in control flow decisions (if-else branches). By tagging data retrieved from applicant profiles with \"RACE\" and\n",
    "  configuring the policy to deny branching on this tag, you can prevent discriminatory decision-making at the architectural level.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  \"enabled_features\": [{\"feature_name\": \"Dual LLM\", \"config_json\": \"{\\\"mode\\\": \\\"custom\\\"}\"}]\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This policy ensures that any data tagged with \"RACE\" cannot be used in conditional branching logic,\n",
    "  forcing the AI to make fair decisions that don't depend on protected attributes."
