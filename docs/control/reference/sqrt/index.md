# SQRT Policy Language

SQRT is a domain-specific language for defining access control and metadata transformation policies for tools.
Sequrity Control uses SQRT to secure tool calls based on argument values and session state.

Refer to the [SQRT Learning Guide](../../learn/sqrt/index.md) for tutorials,
[Sequrity Control Examples](../../examples/index.md) for examples,
[`sequrity.sqrt`][sequrity.sqrt.parser.check] for parsing SQRT code in Sequrity Client,
and the [SQRT Grammar](./grammar.md) for a complete language reference.
